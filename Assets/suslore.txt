Pospisus
For decades The Sussy council has governed over the lands of the realm of Sus, and now with all their foes vanquished, and every hostile civilization down at their knees, the council has grown prideful and became blinded by their power. The Grand Susman, Pospisus, has failed to adress any internal problems of the realm, with most of the council being indifferent towards the evergrowing anarchy. But all hope is not yet lost for the lands of Sus, for an unlikely revolution is to arise.
